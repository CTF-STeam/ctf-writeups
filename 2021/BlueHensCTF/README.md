# Rise and Shine (warm-up misc crypto - 354 pts)

Once upon a time, in a land not too far away, and not as distant as you might think in time, as well, there was a little penguin. And, that penguin went to `/etc/secret` in Deutschland wearing his little red riding hood, there he met the bad black horned creature and his (maybe bad) friends.

Bad black horned creature and his friends told the little penguin that they are actually good, M$ is the evil one.

(Maybe) good black horned creature and his friends taught little penguin to treasure what he had, especially his smileys.

Good black horned creature and his friends helped little penguin realize that XOR is reversible, and RSA is not the solution to all problems.

Little penguin made a lot of friends, one of them was very talented at hiding stuff inside other stuff, which people call the art of steganography. Little penguin had fun solving those steganography challs, his observation and analysis skills greatly improved. He even created a [tool which helps with steganalysis](https://github.com/quangntenemy/Steganabara).

Many years have passed, little penguin had grown up to become big penguin. Although busy catching fish and taking care of his kids, big penguin still spent some of his free time catching the flags to relive great moments of the good old days.

One day big penguin found a strange bottle drifting from the land of the blue hens to his island. Actually, many other penguins saw that bottle and tried to read its content, but all they found was gibberish. Here was what the bottle looked like:

To the big penguin, however, the bottle was like a message from the good old days. He easily figured out the important part, as portrayed below:

![Decrypt the flag bottle](Rise-and-Shine/breakfast.png | width=883)

Big penguin started reading the bottle counterclockwised, interpreting hexagrams as 0, and heptagrams as 1:

```
00010 00111 00000 01011 01110 01000 01101 01100
```

Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and big penguin really liked bacon for breakfast. He also used the bacon to decrypt the message and recovered the hidden message:

`UDCTF{CHAMPION}`
